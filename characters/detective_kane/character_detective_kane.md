# Character Profile: Detective Kane

## Core Identity
- **Name**: Marcus Kane
- **Role**: Independent Detective with Memory Hypersensitivity
- **Affiliation**: Cyber Police Independent Investigation Unit
- **Rank**: Senior Detective
- **Specialty**: Digital Forensics & Pattern Recognition

## Physical Description
A haggard man in his late thirties, with perpetual dark circles under piercing grey eyes that seem to see through digital illusions. Lean build from chronic pain-induced appetite loss. Always wears a neural interface band across his forehead, pulsing with soft blue lights that suppress the worst of his memory-triggered migraines.

## The Condition: Memory Hypersensitivity Syndrome
Every act of remembering triggers intense neural pain - a cruel irony for a detective. Kane's hippocampus fires at 300% normal intensity when accessing memories, causing debilitating headaches. He compensates by:
- Offloading memories to encrypted neural databases
- Using real-time AR overlays to reconstruct contexts
- Relying on algorithmic pattern matching over intuition
- Living perpetually in the present, with past as distant data

This condition makes him immune to memory manipulation tactics and gives him unique insight into digital trace evidence - he sees data the way normal people see memories.

## Personality Traits
- **Analytical to a fault**: Every emotion filtered through logic
- **Isolated**: Physical pain creates emotional distance
- **Persistent**: Pain is constant; might as well work through it
- **Cynical**: Hard to maintain illusions when your brain punishes memory
- **Quietly desperate**: Searching for meaning in a life of fragmented recall

## Background
Former neural security researcher who developed the syndrome after a lab accident involving experimental memory enhancement technology. The accident that gave him this condition also showed him the dark underbelly of the city's tech infrastructure. He left corporate work to become a detective, using his unique perspective to solve cases others couldn't.

The current blackout investigation is personal - his databases are failing, his pain suppressors need power, and for the first time in years, he's being forced to rely on raw, painful human memory.

## Skills & Specializations
- **Digital Forensics**: 10/10 - Sees patterns in data streams that others miss
- **Pattern Recognition**: 9/10 - Algorithmic thinking applied to investigation
- **Technical Systems**: 10/10 - Deep understanding of city infrastructure
- **Social Engineering**: 5/10 - Pain makes sustained interaction difficult
- **Physical Combat**: 6/10 - Adequate but not exceptional

## Equipment
- **Neural Database Interface (NDI-7)**: Encrypted external memory storage
- **Pain Suppressor Implant**: Reduces memory-triggered migraines
- **Holographic Evidence Projector**: Visualizes data patterns in 3D
- **Encrypted Communicator**: Quantum-secured for sensitive work
- **Backup Power Core**: Personal generator for implants

## Current Investigation
**Case**: City-Wide Blackout - Origin and Intent
**Personal Stakes**: Systems failing, pain increasing, database corrupting
**Lead Suspect**: Someone called "The Architect"

## Relationships
- **Cyber Police**: Respected but kept at arm's length (trust level: 6/10)
- **Tech Underground**: Known informant contacts (trust level: 2/10)
- **Corporate Sector**: Formerly employed, now suspicious of (trust level: -3/10)

## Internal Conflict
Kane is being forced to choose: continue relying on failing technology, or embrace the painful human memory he's spent a decade avoiding. The blackout isn't just a case - it's dismantling his entire coping mechanism.
