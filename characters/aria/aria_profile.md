The Great Purge at age eight destroyed her family's stability, forcing her into the underground networks where she discovered natural talents for stealth and social navigation. Mentored first by street fence Old Kess, then by the enigmatic Elder Thorne, she evolved from desperate survivor to sophisticated operative who bridges multiple worlds while belonging fully to none.
