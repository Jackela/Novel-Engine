### Resolution Applied
```typescript
// BEFORE: Missing React import
import { Box, IconButton, ... } from '@mui/material';

// AFTER: Fixed React import
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Box, IconButton, ... } from '@mui/material';

// Also updated useState usage
const [isRunning, setIsRunning] = useState(false); // was React.useState
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Complete application recovery with all components rendering
