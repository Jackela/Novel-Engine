## Quality Enforcement Workflow

### Development Workflow
1. **Pre-commit hooks** validate code before commit
2. **Local testing** with comprehensive test runner
3. **Quality gates** ensure standards compliance
4. **CI/CD pipeline** validates all changes

### Quality Gates Pipeline
1. **Code formatting** (Black, isort, Flake8)
2. **Type checking** (MyPy static analysis)  
3. **Security scanning** (Bandit, Safety)
4. **Test execution** (pytest with coverage)
5. **Performance validation** (benchmark tests)

### Continuous Integration
- **Multi-Python testing** (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- **Cross-platform validation** (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS ready)
- **Automated reporting** with PR comments
- **Quality metrics tracking** over time

## Usage Instructions

### Run Quality Gates
```bash
python scripts/quality_gates.py
```

### Run Test Suite
```bash
python scripts/run_tests.py --mode all --verbose
```

### Generate Coverage Report
```bash
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### Install Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Build Documentation
```bash
mkdocs serve  # Local development
mkdocs build  # Production build
```
