title: "Shadows of Serenity Station"
setting: |
  An abandoned Imperial monitoring station on the edge of the Ghoul Stars, 
  where long-range sensors once watched for xenos incursions. The station 
  has been silent for months, but recent automated distress signals suggest 
  something still moves within its corridors.

atmosphere: |
  Tense investigation with gothic horror elements. The station feels 
  haunted by its past, with flickering lights, strange sounds, and 
  the constant sense of being watched. Discovery and dialogue drive 
  the narrative rather than combat.
