Integration Test for Warhammer 40k Multi-Agent Simulator
========================================================

This integration test validates the complete interaction between PersonaAgent and DirectorAgent classes,
ensuring that the Phase 1 multi-agent orchestration system works correctly end-to-end.

**Test Mission**: Validate complete PersonaAgent ↔ DirectorAgent workflow integration.

**Test Implementation**:
1. Initialize DirectorAgent instance with clean testing environment
2. Create TWO separate PersonaAgent instances using existing test_character.md
3. Register both agents with DirectorAgent and verify registration success
4. Execute exactly one simulation turn via director_agent.run_turn()
5. Validate campaign_log.md file creation and content structure
6. Count and verify exactly two agent action entries in the log
7. Confirm both agents' decision_loop methods were called correctly

**Integration Focus**:
- PersonaAgent.decision_loop called by DirectorAgent.run_turn
- DirectorAgent properly logs agent actions to campaign_log.md
- End-to-end simulation workflow functions correctly
- File I/O operations work as expected

**Error Handling**:
- Missing test_character.md file
- File permission issues
- Agent registration failures
- Campaign log creation problems
