# Specification Quality Checklist: CI/CD Coverage Alignment and Test Configuration Synchronization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED

### Content Quality Review
- ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT (coverage alignment, configuration sync) and WHY (developer productivity, CI/CD efficiency) without HOW
- ✅ User stories are business-focused (developer validates locally, understands requirements, fast feedback)
- ✅ Written for stakeholders to understand value proposition without technical jargon
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are definite
- ✅ Every functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-001: "enforce 30% threshold" can be verified by checking config files)
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., SC-002: "completes within 25 minutes", SC-004: "26.42% to 30%")
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation (e.g., SC-001: "local validation matches GitHub Actions" not "pytest config matches")
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format for all user stories
- ✅ Edge cases identified (coverage threshold changes, Python version differences, uncommitted changes, etc.)
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded with Out of Scope section (no test creation, no parallelization, no pre-commit hooks)
- ✅ Dependencies listed (pytest, act CLI, workflows) and Assumptions documented (Python 3.9+, 30% realistic target)

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to success criteria (e.g., FR-001 coverage consistency → SC-008 config alignment)
- ✅ User scenarios prioritized (P1: local validation, P2: understanding requirements, P2: fast CI, P3: act CLI)
- ✅ Feature delivers measurable business value (80% reduction in push rejections, 3-minute vs 30+ minute feedback)
- ✅ No technical implementation leaked (focuses on behaviors like "tests pass" not "pytest runner executes")

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1-P3) with independent test criteria
- Comprehensive edge cases that anticipate real-world scenarios
- Measurable success criteria with specific percentages and timings
- Well-defined scope boundaries (what's in vs. out)
- Business-focused language suitable for non-technical stakeholders

**No issues found** - all checklist items pass validation.
