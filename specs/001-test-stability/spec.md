# Feature Specification: Test Stability Compliance

**Feature Branch**: `001-test-stability`  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Pass all tests, (may need to change the test cases sometimes, but it should fix the issues instead of bypassing them), to keep a high coding quality with robustness and functionability Update the specs"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - QA Lead verifies clean regression run (Priority: P1)

As the QA Lead, I need every automated suite (unit, contract, integration, E2E, performance smoke) to complete without failures so that I can certify the release candidate without manual overrides.

**Why this priority**: Without a green end-to-end test run, the release cannot be approved and operational risk increases.

**Independent Test**: Trigger the full CI pipeline using the standard `validate_platform.py` workflow and confirm all suites return PASS statuses with captured artifacts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the latest code on `001-test-stability`, **When** the complete automated pipeline runs, **Then** every suite reports PASS with no quarantined or skipped critical tests.  
2. **Given** a previously failing test, **When** fixes are applied, **Then** the test passes and the remediation notes explain the root cause in the Test Remediation Log.

---

### User Story 2 - Developer resolves failing or flaky tests (Priority: P2)

As a Developer, I want clear guidance to diagnose failing or flaky tests and update code or expectations appropriately so that we fix defects instead of masking symptoms.

**Why this priority**: Engineers need actionable information to address failures quickly and prevent regressions.

**Independent Test**: Review the Test Remediation Log and supporting documentation for each resolved failure to confirm defect origins, corrective actions, and verification evidence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a failing test caused by product behavior, **When** the developer applies a fix, **Then** both the code and the associated test expectations align with documented requirements and pass in CI.  
2. **Given** a flaky test caused by invalid assumptions, **When** the developer updates the test, **Then** they document the rationale and add guards (e.g., deterministic data setup) so the test remains stable for five consecutive runs.

---

### User Story 3 - Release Manager confirms governance updates (Priority: P3)

As the Release Manager, I need the specification, plan, and tasks templates to call out the “all tests must pass” gate so that future features inherit the quality requirement automatically.

**Why this priority**: Governance artifacts must reflect the enforced quality bar to prevent regressions in future workstreams.

**Independent Test**: Inspect updated spec/plan/tasks documents to ensure they reference the mandatory regression gate and that the Constitution Gate Workbook captures the completed review.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the updated specification and plan, **When** I review their Constitution Alignment sections, **Then** each includes the requirement that all automated tests pass before completion.  
2. **Given** future `/speckit.plan` and `/speckit.tasks` runs, **When** they generate Constitution Check sections, **Then** the “Quality Engineering & Testing Discipline” gate explicitly mentions passing all suites.

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- How do we respond when new bugs surface during regression remediation (e.g., breaking functional behavior while fixing tests)?
- What is the protocol if a test fails only in specific environments (local vs. CI vs. staging)?
- How do we handle situations where a third-party dependency changes behavior and invalidates existing assertions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The team MUST deliver a documented Test Remediation Log capturing each failing or flaky test, its root cause, the chosen fix, and post-fix validation evidence.  
- **FR-002**: All automated suites (unit, contract, integration, E2E, performance smoke, security lint) MUST complete with PASS status in CI and on a production-like environment before the branch is considered done.  
- **FR-003**: Any test expectation updates MUST include rationale linking to requirements or user scenarios and MUST be peer-reviewed to ensure we are not masking legitimate defects.  
- **FR-004**: The specification, plan, and tasks templates generated for this feature MUST reference the “all tests must pass” gate within their Constitution Alignment and Constitution Check sections.  
- **FR-005**: A regression monitoring cadence MUST be established (minimum daily during stabilization) with owners assigned to review CI dashboards and escalate new failures within 4 business hours.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Test Remediation Log**: Central record of failures, root causes, fixes, validation runs, owners, and completion dates.  
- **Regression Stability Dashboard**: Aggregated view of suite status, flake rates, and timing metrics used by QA Lead and Release Manager.  
- **Governance Template Update Record**: Documentation of updates to spec/plan/tasks templates and Constitution workbook references.

## Assumptions

- Existing failing tests are due to identifiable defects or outdated assertions, not fundamental architectural gaps.  
- The CI environment mirrors staging closely enough that a green run provides confidence for release.  
- Necessary stakeholders (QA Lead, Release Manager, developers) are available to review and approve remediation notes within one business day.

## Constitution Alignment *(mandatory)*

- **Domain-Driven Narrative Core**: Validate that fixes respect bounded contexts—any domain logic changes follow ADR ARC-001 and update relevant context documentation if behavior shifts.  
- **Contract-First Experience APIs**: Ensure contract tests reflect current API behavior; if expectations change, update OpenAPI fragments and notify consumers through the contract governance process.  
- **Data Stewardship & Persistence Discipline**: Confirm that remediation work retains tenant isolation and audit trails, especially when adjusting fixtures or seed data.  
- **Quality Engineering & Testing Discipline**: Mandate a green run across pytest, Pact, Playwright, k6 smoke, mutation, and security lint suites; document failures and resolutions in the remediation log.  
- **Operability, Security & Reliability**: Monitor observability signals during regression runs, update runbooks if new incident playbooks are needed, and ensure feature flags guard any risky changes.  
- **Documentation & Knowledge Stewardship**: Update README/testing guides with the stabilized workflow, refresh Constitution Gate Workbook entries, and link remediation artifacts in `PROJECT_INDEX.md`.  
- Workbook Reference: Will be logged in `docs/governance/constitution-checks.md` with the 001-test-stability gate review upon completion.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of automated suites (unit, contract, integration, E2E, performance smoke, security lint) pass consecutively in CI for five runs following remediation.  
- **SC-002**: Flaky test occurrence rate drops below 1% across monitored suites over a rolling 7-day window.  
- **SC-003**: All remediation entries include owner sign-off within one business day, as recorded in the Test Remediation Log.  
- **SC-004**: Updated governance templates and Constitution workbook references are published and acknowledged by QA Lead and Release Manager before the feature exits Draft status.
