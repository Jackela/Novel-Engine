# Feature Specification: Frontend Type Safety and Styling SSOT

**Feature Branch**: `001-ts-ssot-frontend`  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Focused review and pragmatic plan to improve the frontend with TypeScript rigor, stricter linting, and a single source of truth for design tokens (SSOT), including tsconfig hardening, TS linting, unified tokens/theme, server state caching, and CI checks."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Enforce Strong Type Safety (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I can rely on strict, project-wide type checking and linting so that type errors and unsafe patterns are caught early and consistently across the codebase.

**Why this priority**: Prevents regressions and speeds development by surfacing issues at compile/lint time rather than runtime.

**Independent Test**: Run type-check and lint commands on current HEAD and verify they pass; intentionally introduce violations and observe they are flagged.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given the repository, When a type-check is executed, Then it completes without errors and blocks common unsafe patterns (e.g., implicit any, unused locals).
2. Given a TS lint rule violation is introduced, When lint runs in CI, Then the pipeline reports failure with actionable feedback.

### User Story 2 - Single Source of Truth for Styling (Priority: P2)

As a designer/developer, I can update design tokens in one place and have components and styles reflect those values consistently without duplicated color or spacing literals.

**Why this priority**: Eliminates drift and ensures consistent visual language at scale.

**Independent Test**: Update a token value and verify the change propagates to components and CSS without manual edits elsewhere.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a change to a brand color token, When the app is built, Then components and styles reflect the new color without searching/replacing hard-coded hex values.
2. Given a newly created component, When using the styling system, Then it consumes tokens rather than local literals for color, spacing, and typography.

### User Story 3 - Predictable Server-State Caching (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I can consume server data through a standardized, cache-aware access pattern that deduplicates requests and exposes loading/error states without bespoke plumbing.

**Why this priority**: Reduces custom caching logic and improves reliability of data fetching.

**Independent Test**: Convert one read endpoint to the standardized pattern and verify deduplication, caching, and status exposure.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given multiple concurrent consumers of the same data, When they request it, Then only a single network call is made and results are shared.
2. Given a stale cache entry, When data invalidation is triggered, Then subsequent consumers receive fresh data without code duplication.

### Edge Cases

- Token change that reduces contrast: ensure accessible contrast thresholds remain satisfied and expose a failing check if not.
- Type-safety rules in generated code: ensure code generation and ambient types do not break CI (provide overrides at boundaries only).
- Offline or flaky network: standardized data access still exposes consistent loading/error states without hanging UI.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The project MUST enforce strict static analysis and type-checking rules that prevent unsafe constructs (e.g., implicit any, fallthrough in switches, unchecked indexed access).
- **FR-002**: Linting MUST cover TypeScript files and fail on violations relevant to correctness and maintainability.
- **FR-003**: Styling MUST consume a single set of design tokens; direct color/spacing literals in component code are disallowed except in the tokens source.
- **FR-004**: A unified theme MUST be derived from the same tokens to ensure consistent typography, color, spacing, elevation, and motion.
- **FR-005**: At least one representative component group MUST be refactored to consume tokens/theme instead of literals (proof of adoption).
- **FR-006**: Server data access MUST provide request deduplication, caching, invalidation, and standardized loading/error states without custom per-call plumbing.
- **FR-007**: Boundary parsing MUST normalize dates and unknown payloads to safe internal types with tests covering success and malformed cases.
- **FR-008**: Continuous integration MUST run type-check, lint, and unit tests and report failures pre-merge.

Decisions (clarifications resolved):

- **FR-009**: Styling SSOT propagation MUST be via a build-generated stylesheet emitted from tokens; runtime updates are not required for v1.
- **FR-010**: All read endpoints MUST migrate to the standardized server-state access pattern within this feature.
- **FR-011**: CI MUST block merges on type-check/lint violations and token-usage violations from day one of adoption.

### Assumptions & Dependencies

- Tokens will serve as the single semantic reference for colors, typography, spacing, elevation, and motion.
- Existing visual identity remains; only the source and propagation mechanism changes.
- Initial server-state standardization will target read flows; write flows can follow after evaluation.
- CI infrastructure exists and can be extended with additional jobs for type-check, lint, and unit tests.
- No backward compatibility constraints: project is pre-deploy; refactors may freely change internal APIs/components to align with SSOT and type safety.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Design Tokens**: Canonical values for color, typography, spacing, elevation, motion. Attributes: name, semantic purpose, value, constraints (e.g., contrast).
- **Theme**: Derived presentation system that maps tokens to component-level variables and scales.
- **Data DTOs**: Structured representations of server responses with explicit fields (dates as ISO strings), plus parsing rules to internal types.
- **Query Keys**: Stable identifiers for server-state entries used for caching, deduplication, and invalidation.

## Constitution Alignment *(mandatory)*

- **Domain-Driven Narrative Core**: No domain semantics change; improves presentation and client boundary discipline. Record an ADR for styling SSOT and server-state access standard.
- **Contract-First Experience APIs**: Client-side DTOs align with existing API contracts; add lightweight schema notes where transformations occur.
- **Data Stewardship & Persistence Discipline**: No data retention changes. Document date normalization and error handling at boundaries.
- **Quality Engineering & Testing Discipline**: Add type-check, lint, and unit tests as quality gates; add tests for parsing and token drift.
- **Operability, Security & Reliability**: Reduced client errors via stricter checks; no new security surface.
- **Documentation & Knowledge Stewardship**: Update design system guide to declare tokens as SSOT and describe update workflow.
- Workbook Reference: docs/governance/constitution-checks.md (to be linked post-creation)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Type-check passes in CI with zero errors; introducing an implicit-unsafe pattern causes CI failure within 5 minutes of push.
- **SC-002**: Lint covers 100% of `.ts/.tsx` files; intentional rule violations fail CI with actionable messages.
- **SC-003**: Zero hard-coded color hex values remain in targeted component set; token update propagates to refactored components without code edits outside the tokens; hex-ban lint checks enforce compliance in TSX and CSS.
- **SC-004**: One representative read flow demonstrates request deduplication and cache invalidation; concurrent duplicate requests generate a single network call.
- **SC-005**: Parsing tests achieve â‰¥90% statement coverage for DTO transforms and include at least three malformed payload cases.
