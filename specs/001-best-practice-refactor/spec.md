# Feature Specification: Project Best-Practice Refactor

**Feature Branch**: `001-best-practice-refactor`  
**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "我需要按照最佳实践来重构项目"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

For each story, state the bounded context it touches (e.g., Simulation Orchestration, Persona Intelligence, Narrative Delivery, Platform Ops) and note any ports/adapters or anti-corruption layers affected.

### User Story 1 - Architect Maps Domain Boundaries (Priority: P1)
**Bounded Contexts**: Simulation Orchestration, Persona Intelligence, Narrative Delivery. Ports/Adapters: existing agent orchestration APIs, Gemini integration anti-corruption layer.

As the platform architect, I want a definitive blueprint that refactors services into explicit bounded contexts with clear aggregates, ports, and adapters so that teams can implement changes without cross-context side effects.

**Why this priority**: Without a canonical domain map, refactoring risks regressions and conflicting interpretations of the modules; this story unblocks all subsequent work.

**Independent Test**: Review completed context catalog, aggregate definitions, and hexagonal port inventory in the ADR bundle; validate against constitution checklist without touching code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the current architecture documentation is fragmented, **When** the blueprint is produced, **Then** every module and integration is assigned to a bounded context with owner, aggregates, and invariants documented.  
2. **Given** Persona Intelligence relies on Gemini APIs, **When** the anti-corruption layer is cataloged, **Then** the blueprint lists its port, adapter, fallback strategy, and contract.

---

### User Story 2 - Delivery Lead Aligns Contracts & Workflows (Priority: P2)
**Bounded Contexts**: Narrative Delivery, Platform Operations. Ports/Adapters: REST/GraphQL experience APIs, front-end BFF gateway.

As the delivery lead, I need refactored API contracts, workflow checklists, and testing expectations that conform to contract-first and quality principles so that front-end and automation teams can continue shipping without breaking changes.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the refactor preserves outward-facing behavior while documenting new governance gates for development.

**Independent Test**: Validate updated OpenAPI/GraphQL drafts, rate-limit policies, and constitution-aligned workflow checklists through artifact review and simulated contract linting.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** APIs currently lack rate-limit and idempotency documentation, **When** the refactor artifacts are delivered, **Then** each endpoint includes limit, retry, and error model references.  
2. **Given** planning templates drive development, **When** constitution gates are refreshed, **Then** `/speckit.plan` Constitution Check mirrors the new principles with no gaps.

---

### User Story 3 - Reliability Captain Drives Operational Excellence (Priority: P3)
**Bounded Contexts**: Platform Operations. Ports/Adapters: Observability pipeline (OTel exporters), deployment tooling, feature flag service.

As the reliability captain, I want updated runbooks, observability baselines, and resiliency guardrails defined so that the refactored system can be deployed, monitored, and rolled back safely.

**Why this priority**: Stabilizes production post-refactor and satisfies Operability, Security & Reliability principles.

**Independent Test**: Run tabletop exercises using updated runbooks and confirm telemetry dashboards, SLOs, and feature flag plans exist without code deployment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** incident response currently lacks feature-flag guidance, **When** runbooks are refreshed, **Then** they document rollout steps, error budgets, and rollback triggers referencing new architecture.  
2. **Given** metrics dashboards are outdated, **When** observability requirements are defined, **Then** the RED/USE metrics list identifies sources, owners, and alert thresholds.

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when multiple modules straddle more than one bounded context (e.g., shared utilities or legacy monolith code)?
- How does the refactor handle discrepancies between documented contracts and actual runtime behavior discovered during audit?
- What is the behavior under multi-tenant or concurrency pressure (read/write separation, stale reads)?
- How are failures in external adapters/legacy systems isolated via anti-corruption layers?
- How are historical campaign logs and saved states migrated or grandfathered to the new aggregates without data loss?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001 (Context: Simulation Orchestration, Contract: Architecture ADR)**: System MUST deliver a refactoring blueprint that enumerates aggregates, commands, events, and invariants for Director, Persona, and Chronicler agents, mapping each to hexagonal ports and adapters.  
- **FR-002 (Context: Platform Operations, Contract: Governance Checklist)**: System MUST produce updated Constitution Checks and workflow checklists that encode the six core principles as non-negotiable gates for planning, specification, tasks, and reviews.  
- **FR-003 (Context: Narrative Delivery, Contract: OpenAPI/GraphQL)**: System MUST reconcile existing experience APIs with contract-first rules, including idempotency keys, rate limits, pagination rules, error schemas (RFC 7807), and versioning headers.  
- **FR-004 (Context: Persona Intelligence, Contract: Anti-Corruption Layer Spec)**: System MUST document persona adapter responsibilities (Gemini fallback, caching, retries) and define how data flows respect tenant isolation and audit requirements.  
- **FR-005 (Context: Platform Operations, Contract: Observability Charter)**: System MUST specify the telemetry signals (traces, metrics, logs) and incident response hooks required to monitor the refactored architecture end-to-end.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Bounded Context Charter**: Captures context purpose, aggregates, invariants, ports, adapters, owner, and upstream/downstream relationships.  
- **Contract Compliance Register**: Tracks each API/queue/topic contract, associated version, consumer commitments, rate limits, idempotency strategy, and migration notes.  
- **Operational Runbook Portfolio**: Collection of deployment, rollback, incident, and observability playbooks linked to feature flags, SLO dashboards, and contact paths.

### Non-Functional & Operability Requirements

- **NFR-001 (SLO)**: Define SLOs per bounded context (latency, throughput, error budget) and map them to RED/USE dashboards with owner and measurement cadence.  
- **NFR-002 (Observability)**: Require OpenTelemetry traces for 99% of critical requests, structured logs containing traceId/spanId/userId, and metrics exported to the central dashboard catalog.  
- **NFR-003 (Security)**: Document access controls, RBAC/ABAC roles, token validation steps, rate limiting tiers, and data protection commitments for each context.  
- **NFR-004 (Resiliency)**: Specify mandatory timeouts, retry policies with exponential backoff, circuit breakers, and bulkheads for inter-context communication and external API calls.  
- **NFR-005 (Deployment/Rollout)**: Provide feature-flag rollout strategy, staged deployment plan (canary/blue-green), rollback triggers tied to error budgets, and migration/backfill sequencing.

## Assumptions

- The refactor is documentation, governance, and lightweight-configuration focused; only minor code annotations or scripts needed to enforce best practices are performed here, with substantive behavioral changes deferred to later stories.  
- Current environments (development, staging, production) remain available for discovery activities without downtime.  
- Legacy artifacts not explicitly mapped to a bounded context are flagged for deprecation but remain functional until implementation phases execute.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of repository modules and services are assigned to a bounded context with documented aggregates, ports, and adapters.  
- **SC-002**: 100% of public-facing APIs have updated contracts covering rate limits, idempotency, pagination, and RFC 7807 error responses reviewed by stakeholders.  
- **SC-003**: Planning, specification, and task templates embed the new constitutional gates with no gaps identified during checklist dry-run.  
- **SC-004**: All critical runbooks (deployment, rollback, incident response) are updated and validated through a tabletop exercise with participation from architecture, QA, and operations leads.  
- **SC-005**: Observability charter identifies RED/USE metrics, dashboards, and alert thresholds for each bounded context, approved by the reliability captain.
