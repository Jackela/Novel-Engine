# Contracts Overview

This feature does not introduce new external APIs. It standardizes client handling of existing read endpoints used in primary flows to ensure predictable loading and error states.

Documented for reference:
- GET /health
- GET /meta/system-status
- GET /characters
- GET /characters/{name}
- GET /characters/{name}/enhanced
- POST /characters

If server contracts change, update OpenAPI specs at the platform level and link them here.
