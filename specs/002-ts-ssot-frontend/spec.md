# Feature Specification: Frontend Type Safety and Styling SSOT

**Feature Branch**: `002-ts-ssot-frontend`  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: Ready for Review  
**Input**: Improve frontend quality with stronger static typing and a single source of truth for styling tokens, aligned to industry best practices.

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### User Story 1 - Consistent Visual System (Priority: P1)

End users experience a consistent, accessible visual design across the application because all components derive colors, spacing, and typography from centralized tokens.

**Why this priority**: Inconsistent styling erodes trust and usability. A unified token system delivers immediate value to all users across every screen.

**Independent Test**: Run a visual consistency check on key screens and verify no component relies on hard-coded visual values; tokens drive appearance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given the app styles load, When navigating between primary pages, Then color and spacing remain consistent across headers, buttons, inputs, and cards.
2. Given a design token update (e.g., primary color), When the app reloads, Then all affected components reflect the change without manual edits.
3. Given default themes, When assessing text/background combinations, Then contrast meets accessibility targets across primary UI components.

### User Story 2 - Contributor-Friendly Styling (Priority: P2)

Contributors can add or adjust design tokens in one place and see those changes propagate to both the application theme and CSS variables without duplication.

**Why this priority**: Reduces maintenance cost and prevents drift between styling layers; accelerates onboarding and code reviews.

**Independent Test**: Add a new token and observe it appear in both the theme and CSS variables output; documentation instructs how to do this in minutes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a documented token format, When a contributor adds a spacing token, Then it is immediately available in styles and component themes.
2. Given contributor guidance, When a developer builds the app, Then a generated stylesheet includes the new token and existing tokens unchanged except intended edits.
3. Given CI gates, When a merge request introduces hard-coded color values, Then the gate fails with a clear message referencing tokens usage.

### User Story 3 - Predictable Data and Loading States (Priority: P3)

End users see reliable loading, error, and success states because primary data reads follow consistent patterns for fetching, caching, and error display.

**Why this priority**: Predictable server interactions reduce user confusion and improve perceived performance across common workflows.

**Independent Test**: Load a primary page with intermittent connectivity and observe consistent loading and error indicators; re-try behavior behaves uniformly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given first-time navigation, When the page requests characters data, Then a unified loading indicator shows and the final state renders data or a clear error.
2. Given a transient failure, When the user retries, Then the system avoids duplicate requests and displays fresh results or a clear error.
3. Given subsequent visits, When revisiting the same data path, Then the system avoids unnecessary network calls and shows consistent states.

### Edge Cases

- Token removal: Removing or renaming a token must fail validation with a clear message and safe fallback guidance.
- Contrast regression: Any change that drops text/background contrast below target must be flagged before merge. Targets: WCAG AA — 4.5:1 for normal text; 3:1 for large text and UI components.
- Missing token usage: Introducing new components with hard-coded values must be detected and blocked by quality gates.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: Styling must be governed by a single, authoritative token set; both the theme and stylesheet must be derived from the same tokens.
- FR-002: No hard-coded visual values (e.g., colors, spacing, radii) are allowed in component code for in-scope areas; gates must detect and prevent violations.
- FR-003: Updating a token must consistently propagate across all in-scope screens without manual component edits.
- FR-004: Primary user flows must present consistent loading, empty, error, and success states using a unified pattern.
- FR-005: Static analysis must catch invalid props and data shapes in primary flows before runtime; merges must be blocked on failures.
- FR-006: Documentation must describe how to add/edit tokens and how UI components consume them, including examples and validation steps.
- FR-007: Accessibility targets must be met for color contrast in standard text and controls across primary screens.

### Key Entities (data involved)

- Design Token: A named value representing color, spacing, typography, radius, or motion that defines the visual system. Attributes: name, role, value, description.
- Theme: A structured mapping from tokens to component-level styles consumed at render time.
- Component: A UI element whose appearance references tokens rather than literal values; state: normal, hover, active, disabled, focus.
- Server Resource: A data source representing a page’s primary content; states: idle, loading, success, error; policies for freshness and retry.

## Constitution Alignment (mandatory)

- Domain-Driven Narrative Core: Aligns UI concerns to a unified “Design System” bounded context; no cross-context styling leaks.
- Contract-First Experience APIs: Data presentation relies on stable contracts; client enforces predictable states for read operations.
- Data Stewardship & Persistence Discipline: No PII changes; tokens contain no user data. Visual consistency reduces misinterpretation risk.
- Quality Engineering & Testing Discipline: Quality gates enforce token usage, static analysis, and contrast targets; smoke tests validate primary flows.
- Operability, Security & Reliability: Consistent error and loading states improve observability and incident triage; no new secrets or roles introduced.
- Documentation & Knowledge Stewardship: Contributor guide documents tokens lifecycle; design system documentation and an ADR capture decisions.
- Workbook Reference: Add entry to `docs/governance/constitution-checks.md` documenting gates and checks for styling and data-state consistency.

## Success Criteria (mandatory)

### Measurable Outcomes

- SC-001: Visual consistency — 100% of in-scope components reference centralized tokens; automated checks report 0 hard-coded visual values in the targeted directories.
- SC-002: Accessibility — At least 95% of text/background pairings on primary screens meet WCAG AA contrast thresholds (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large); any exceptions are documented with rationale and remediation.
- SC-003: Reliability — Primary pages show consistent loading and error states with no duplicate requests observed in manual smoke sessions; retry paths behave uniformly.
- SC-004: Quality gates — Merges are blocked when token usage or static checks fail; passing gates is required for integration.
- SC-005: Change velocity — A token update demonstrably changes at least three distinct UI components without manual component edits within one development cycle.

### Assumptions

- Static analysis and quality checks are available in CI and locally.
- The project is pre-release; backward compatibility constraints do not apply.
- The scope prioritizes primary user flows and shared components; deep legacy sections can follow in later iterations.

### Dependencies

- Existing component library remains the consumer of the theme/tokens without introducing new visual frameworks.
- Documentation updates accompany token changes to avoid knowledge drift for contributors.

### In-Scope Screens

- Primary screens in scope for this iteration: Dashboard, Character Selection, Character Studio. Additional sections may follow in later phases.
