# Ralph Progress - UI Rescue Phase

## UI-FIX-001 - 2026-01-30
- What I implemented: Fixed catch-all route redirect by changing path from '*' to '$' (TanStack Router splat syntax)
- Pattern discovered: TanStack Router uses '$' for splat/catch-all routes, not '*' like traditional routers
- Gotcha for future: The catch-all route was showing "Not Found" paragraph instead of redirecting because of wrong syntax. Always use '$' for TanStack Router wildcards.

## TEST-FIX-001 - 2026-01-30
- What I implemented: Fixed Playwright headless mode default and added browser cleanup in global teardown
- Changes made:
  1. Changed `headless: process.env.CI ? true : false` to `headless: process.env.HEADED !== 'true'` in both playwright configs
  2. Added `cleanupBrowserContexts()` function to global-teardown.ts that closes lingering browser contexts
  3. Added Windows-specific orphan process cleanup via taskkill
- Pattern discovered: Use inverted env var logic (HEADED=true to show browser) instead of CI detection for headless mode
- Gotcha for future: Always default to headless mode and use explicit opt-in for headed mode during debugging
