## NAR-001 - 2026-01-31T23:50:00
- What I implemented: Verified existing Story & Chapter entities in `src/contexts/narrative/domain/entities/`
- Implementation already complete: Story (title, summary, status DRAFT/PUBLISHED, chapter management) and Chapter (title, summary, order_index, status DRAFT/PUBLISHED)
- Unit tests: 120 tests passed covering Story and Chapter entities (test_story_entity.py, test_chapter_entity.py)
- Pattern discovered: Domain entities use dataclasses with `__post_init__` for validation and `_touch()` for timestamp updates
- Gotcha for future: Story and Chapter already implement full CRUD operations - no need to add more methods unless requirements change
