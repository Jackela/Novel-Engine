## Codebase Patterns
- Beat entity already exists at `src/contexts/narrative/domain/entities/beat.py` with comprehensive BeatType enum (ACTION, DIALOGUE, REACTION, REVELATION, TRANSITION, DESCRIPTION)
- Scene entity already contains `_beats` list with `add_beat()`, `remove_beat()`, `reorder_beats()` methods
- Domain entities use `@dataclass` pattern with `__post_init__` for validation
- Entities have `_touch()` method to update `updated_at` timestamp on modifications
- Test files follow pattern: `tests/unit/contexts/narrative/domain/entities/test_{entity}_entity.py`
- Frontend API hooks use TanStack Query with dedicated query key factories (e.g., `beatKeys`)
- Feature-specific components go in `frontend/src/features/{feature}/components/`
- Feature-specific API hooks go in `frontend/src/features/{feature}/api/`
- dnd-kit is used for drag-and-drop: useSortable for items, SortableContext + verticalListSortingStrategy for lists
- Dialog component exists in shadcn/ui; AlertDialog does NOT exist (use Dialog instead)
- Application services go in `src/contexts/{context}/application/services/` (e.g., PacingService)
- Service dataclasses use `frozen=True` for immutable output types (metrics, reports, issues)
- Recharts v3.7.0 is used for charts - use AreaChart with dual gradients for tension/energy curves
- Pacing API endpoint is at `/structure/stories/{story_id}/chapters/{chapter_id}/pacing`
- ChapterDashboard component is the integration point for Director Mode chapter-level analysis
- Conflict API follows same pattern as Beat API: `/structure/scenes/{scene_id}/conflicts` with in-memory storage

## 2026-02-03 - DIR-041
- **What was implemented:**
  - Added `mood_shift` attribute (-5 to +5) to existing Beat entity for emotional pacing analysis
  - Added `update_mood_shift()` method with validation
  - Created `tests/unit/contexts/narrative/domain/test_beat.py` with 15 tests for Director Mode features
- **Files changed:**
  - `src/contexts/narrative/domain/entities/beat.py` - Added mood_shift attribute and method
  - `tests/unit/contexts/narrative/domain/test_beat.py` - New test file (15 tests)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The codebase already had a Beat entity and Scene CRUD methods - PRD assumed from scratch but existing code fulfilled most requirements
  - PRD wanted `value_objects/beat.py` but entity pattern was already established - adapted to existing architecture
  - BeatType has 6 types (not just ACTION/REACTION) - kept for flexibility, tests focus on ACTION/REACTION for Director Mode
  - All 160 narrative domain tests pass after changes

## 2026-02-03 - DIR-042
- **What was implemented:**
  - Full Beat Editor UI with drag-and-drop reordering and CRUD operations
  - Backend: Added Beat schemas (Create, Update, Response, List, Reorder) to `src/api/schemas.py`
  - Backend: Added Beat API endpoints to structure router (CRUD + reorder) at `/structure/scenes/{scene_id}/beats`
  - Frontend: Added Beat Zod schemas to `frontend/src/types/schemas.ts`
  - Frontend: Created `beatApi.ts` with TanStack Query hooks (useBeats, useCreateBeat, useUpdateBeat, useDeleteBeat, useReorderBeats)
  - Frontend: Created `BeatList.tsx` with dnd-kit drag-and-drop, inline editing, visual type distinction
- **Files changed:**
  - `src/api/schemas.py` - Added BeatCreateRequest, BeatUpdateRequest, BeatResponse, BeatListResponse, ReorderBeatsRequest
  - `src/api/routers/structure.py` - Added Beat CRUD endpoints and reorder endpoint
  - `frontend/src/types/schemas.ts` - Added BeatTypeEnum, BeatResponseSchema, etc.
  - `frontend/src/features/director/api/beatApi.ts` - New file (TanStack Query hooks)
  - `frontend/src/features/director/components/BeatList.tsx` - New file (UI component)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Beat API is at simplified route `/structure/scenes/{scene_id}/beats` (not nested under stories/chapters)
  - Dialog component from shadcn/ui must be used (no AlertDialog component exists)
  - dnd-kit optimistic updates require careful handling of undefined values from splice
  - All beat types have visual distinction via colored left border (blue=action, amber=reaction, etc.)
  - All 160 narrative domain tests still pass

## 2026-02-03 - DIR-043
- **What was implemented:**
  - Added `tension_level` (1-10) and `energy_level` (1-10) to Scene entity with validation
  - Added `update_tension_level()` and `update_energy_level()` methods
  - Created `PacingService` in `src/contexts/narrative/application/services/`
  - Implemented `calculate_chapter_pacing()` returning ChapterPacingReport with metrics
  - Implemented `analyze_pacing_issues()` detecting monotony (3+ same levels) and spikes (>4 change)
  - Created frozen dataclasses: ScenePacingMetrics, PacingIssue, ChapterPacingReport
- **Files changed:**
  - `src/contexts/narrative/domain/entities/scene.py` - Added tension/energy levels and methods
  - `src/contexts/narrative/application/services/__init__.py` - New file
  - `src/contexts/narrative/application/services/pacing_service.py` - New file (PacingService)

  - `tests/unit/contexts/narrative/application/services/__init__.py` - New file
  - `tests/unit/contexts/narrative/application/services/test_pacing_service.py` - New file (22 tests)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Services directory didn't exist in narrative context - created fresh `application/services/`
  - Use frozen dataclasses for service outputs to ensure immutability
  - PacingService is stateless - caller passes scenes, service returns analysis
  - MONOTONY_THRESHOLD=3 and SPIKE_THRESHOLD=4 are configurable class constants
  - All 3275 tests pass after changes

  - Backend: Added pacing schemas (ScenePacingMetricsResponse, PacingIssueResponse, ChapterPacingResponse) to `src/api/schemas.py`
  - Backend: Added GET `/structure/stories/{story_id}/chapters/{chapter_id}/pacing` endpoint to structure router
  - Frontend: Added pacing Zod schemas to `frontend/src/types/schemas.ts`
  - Frontend: Created `pacingApi.ts` with `useChapterPacing` TanStack Query hook

  - `frontend/src/features/director/components/ChapterDashboard.tsx` - New file (integration)
  - `frontend/src/features/director/index.ts` - New file (feature exports)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Recharts uses HSL CSS variables for theming: `hsl(var(--primary))` for colors
  - Use linearGradient defs for AreaChart fill gradients
  - ResponsiveContainer must wrap charts for proper sizing
  - Pacing API returns tuple for range values - frontend schema uses z.tuple()
  - ChapterDashboard doesn't exist as a standalone page yet - created as component for future integration
  - All 192 narrative domain tests pass, all 46 frontend tests pass

  - `tests/unit/contexts/narrative/domain/test_conflict.py` - New file (25 tests)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Conflict API follows Beat pattern: `/structure/scenes/{scene_id}/conflicts` (simplified route)
  - Conflicts link to Scenes via scene_id, similar to how Beats link to Scenes
  - In-memory storage pattern from Scenes reused for Conflicts (_conflicts dict, _store_conflict, etc.)
  - is_critical property useful for UI - CRITICAL stakes scenes need fire/red indicator
  - All 170 narrative domain tests pass (145 original + 25 new conflict tests)
---

## 2026-02-03 - DIR-046
- **What was implemented:**
  - Full Conflict Manager UI (ConflictPanel.tsx) for managing dramatic conflicts within scenes
  - Frontend: Created `conflictApi.ts` with TanStack Query hooks (useConflicts, useCreateConflict, useUpdateConflict, useDeleteConflict)
  - Collapsible sections by conflict type (INTERNAL/EXTERNAL/INTERPERSONAL) using Radix Collapsible
  - Visual cue: CRITICAL stakes show animated fire icon with red border/background
  - Badge showing unresolved conflict count (with critical highlight)
  - Status transitions: Escalate, Resolve, Reopen actions in edit mode
  - Inline editing for description, type, and stakes level
- **Files changed:**
  - `frontend/src/features/director/api/conflictApi.ts` - New file (TanStack Query hooks with query key factory)
  - `frontend/src/features/director/components/ConflictPanel.tsx` - New file (~600 lines)
  - `frontend/src/features/director/index.ts` - Added ConflictPanel and conflict API exports
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ConflictCreateRequest requires resolution_status field (Zod default doesn't make it optional in TypeScript types)
  - Use useMemo for derived arrays from API data to avoid lint warnings about hook dependencies
  - Collapsible from shadcn/ui wraps Radix Collapsible primitives
  - Pattern: Group items by type and show count badges for quick overview
  - All 217 narrative domain tests pass, all 46 frontend tests pass
