## NAR-001 - 2026-01-31T23:50:00
- What I implemented: Verified existing Story & Chapter entities in `src/contexts/narrative/domain/entities/`
- Implementation already complete: Story (title, summary, status DRAFT/PUBLISHED, chapter management) and Chapter (title, summary, order_index, status DRAFT/PUBLISHED)
- Unit tests: 120 tests passed covering Story and Chapter entities (test_story_entity.py, test_chapter_entity.py)
- Pattern discovered: Domain entities use dataclasses with `__post_init__` for validation and `_touch()` for timestamp updates
- Gotcha for future: Story and Chapter already implement full CRUD operations - no need to add more methods unless requirements change

## NAR-002 - 2026-02-01T00:15:00
- What I implemented: Verified existing Scene & Beat entities in `src/contexts/narrative/domain/entities/`
- Implementation already complete:
  - Scene entity: title, chapter_id, summary, order_index, status (DRAFT/GENERATING/REVIEW/PUBLISHED), location, beats management
  - Beat entity: scene_id, content, order_index, beat_type (ACTION/DIALOGUE/REACTION/REVELATION/TRANSITION/DESCRIPTION), notes
  - `reorder_beats()` method fully implemented with validation for missing/extra beat IDs
- Unit tests: 71 tests passed (36 for Scene, 35 for Beat)
- Pattern discovered: SceneStatus has additional states (GENERATING, REVIEW) for LLM workflow tracking
- Gotcha for future: Beat allows empty content (for placeholder beats), unlike Scene which requires a title

## NAR-003 - 2026-02-01T00:30:00
- What I implemented: Verified existing INarrativeRepository port and InMemoryNarrativeRepository adapter
- Implementation already complete:
  - `INarrativeRepository` protocol in `src/contexts/narrative/application/ports/narrative_repository_port.py`
    - Methods: save(), get_by_id() (load), list_all(), delete(), exists()
    - Custom `RepositoryException` for infrastructure errors
  - `InMemoryNarrativeRepository` in `src/contexts/narrative/infrastructure/repositories/`
    - Uses deep copy for isolation between stored/returned aggregates
    - Additional testing helpers: clear(), count property
- Unit tests: 25 tests passed in `test_in_memory_narrative_repository.py`
- Pattern discovered: Repository uses deep copy to prevent external mutations from affecting stored data
- Gotcha for future: The port uses Optional return instead of exceptions for "not found" - follows "Tell, Don't Ask" principle
