## Codebase Patterns (from previous phase)
- Domain entities use dataclasses with `__post_init__` for validation
- Character exists in src/contexts/character/ with CharacterProfile value object
- Location exists with parent_id/child_ids hierarchy in src/contexts/world/
- WorldSetting has world_rules: List[str] field
- Frontend typecheck: `npm run type-check` (with hyphen)
- dnd-kit already installed for drag-drop
- SSE streaming: use fetch + ReadableStream for POST endpoints
