## Quality Improvements

### Before Enhancement
```yaml
Issues:
  - Repetitive dialogue: "是时候了，让我们继续前进" x7
  - Random events with no causality
  - Similar character voices
  - No dramatic structure
  - Flat tension throughout
```

### After Enhancement
```yaml
Improvements:
  - Zero repetition (DialogueMemory)
  - Causal event chains (EventOrchestrator)
  - Unique character voices (CharacterVoice)
  - Three-act structure (StoryArchitect)
  - Dynamic tension curve
```
