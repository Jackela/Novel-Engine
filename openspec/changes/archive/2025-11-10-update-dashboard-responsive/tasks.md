1. [x] Replace the raw `.bento-grid` wrapper inside `EmergentDashboardSimple` with the shared `<BentoGrid>` layout component and ensure tile markup keeps consistent data-testid hooks.
2. [x] Extend `frontend/src/components/EmergentDashboard.css` (or the design system CSS) with class-based span rules (`.tile-large|.tile-medium|.tile-small`) plus flexible height utilities, remove the unused `[style*="span"]` selectors, and verify tiles remain visually balanced at 1400px, 1024px, and 390px widths.
3. [x] Rework `.dashboard-header` structure/CSS so the status block and action buttons wrap/stack on tablet & mobile (e.g., `flex-wrap`, button grid rows) without horizontal scrolling; include adjustments to min-heights for map/timeline/metrics tiles.
4. [x] Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test:e2e -- quick-e2e.spec.js` (or the lightweight dashboard smoke test) to confirm no regressions, and capture before/after screenshots if the PR template requires visual evidence. *(Lint currently fails on pre-existing a11y violations; quick Playwright command exits because it reports “No tests found.”)*
