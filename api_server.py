FastAPI Web Server for StoryForge AI - Interactive Story Engine
===============================================================

This module implements a FastAPI web server that provides RESTful API endpoints
for the StoryForge AI Interactive Story Engine. The server enables web-based access
to the story generation system, allowing external applications and clients to interact
with the intelligent narrative engine through HTTP requests.

The FastAPI server provides:
1. Basic API endpoint with health check functionality
2. JSON response format for API communication
3. Error handling and logging capabilities
4. Extensible structure for future endpoint additions
5. Integration preparation for existing simulator components

This implementation serves as the foundation for web API capabilities that will
later be extended with additional endpoints for simulation control, agent
management, and real-time updates.

        As an Imperial Strategist and Campaign Coordinator, generate a comprehensive mission briefing for this Warhammer 40,000 campaign. The briefing should follow Imperial military doctrine and include:

        ## Structure Required:
        1. **Campaign Brief**: [Campaign Name]
        2. **Mission Overview** - Strategic situation summary
        3. **Primary Objectives** - 3-5 numbered mission goals

        5. **Threat Assessment** - Enemy forces and environmental hazards
        6. **Resources Assigned** - Available Imperial forces and equipment
        7. **Rules of Engagement** - Tactical constraints and protocols
        8. **Expected Duration** - Campaign timeline estimate

        ## Tone and Style:
        - Use authentic Warhammer 40k terminology and atmosphere
        - Maintain Imperial military briefing format
        - Include appropriate faction references
        - Balance grimdark atmosphere with tactical clarity
