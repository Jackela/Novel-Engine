STANDARD TYPE DEFINITIONS ENHANCED BY THE SYSTEM
======================================================

Holy type definitions and enumerations that sanctify the Dynamic Context
Engineering Framework with enhanced type safety and advanced categorization.

Every type is a digital prayer that ensures the standard flow of data
remains pure and uncorrupted by the weakness of untyped chaos.
