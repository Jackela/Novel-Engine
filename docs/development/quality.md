# Quality Assurance Framework

Novel Engine implements comprehensive quality assurance practices to ensure reliability, maintainability, and security.

## Quality Standards

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum Coverage**: 90% line coverage
- **Branch Coverage**: 85% minimum
- **Critical Path Coverage**: 100% for core functionality

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Max 10 per function
- **Maintainability Index**: Above 70
- **Technical Debt Ratio**: Below 5%

## Quality Gates

### 1. Code Formatting
All code must pass automated formatting checks:

```bash
# Check formatting
python -m black --check src tests
python -m isort --check-only src tests
python -m flake8 src tests
```

### 2. Type Checking
Static type analysis ensures code correctness:

```bash
python -m mypy src --ignore-missing-imports
```

### 3. Security Scanning
Security vulnerabilities are automatically detected:

```bash
# Security linting
python -m bandit -r src

# Dependency vulnerability check
python -m safety check
```

### 4. Test Execution
Comprehensive test suite validation:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=90
```

### 5. Performance Validation
Performance regression detection:

```bash
# Performance tests
python -m pytest -m performance --benchmark-only
```

## Quality Gates Script

Use our automated quality gates script:

```bash
python scripts/quality_gates.py
```

This runs all quality checks and generates a comprehensive report.

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Pipeline
Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

1. **Code Quality Checks**: Formatting, linting, type checking
2. **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability detection and dependency checks
3. **Test Suite**: Multi-version testing with coverage reporting
4. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end scenario validation
5. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark and regression testing
6. **Quality Gates**: Comprehensive validation before merge

### Pre-commit Hooks
Automated quality checks before commits:

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Run hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Quality Metrics Dashboard

### Coverage Reports
- **HTML Report**: `htmlcov/index.html`
- **XML Report**: `coverage.xml` (for CI integration)
- **Terminal Report**: Real-time coverage display

### Security Reports
- **Bandit Report**: `bandit-report.json`
- **Safety Report**: `safety-report.json`

### Performance Reports
- **Benchmark Results**: `benchmark.json`
- **Performance Trends**: Historical performance tracking

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests
1. **Test Naming**: Use descriptive names that explain the scenario
2. **Test Structure**: Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
3. **Test Coverage**: Cover happy path, error cases, and edge cases
4. **Test Isolation**: Tests should be independent and idempotent

### Code Quality
1. **Single Responsibility**: Functions and classes should have one clear purpose
2. **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
3. **Documentation**: Document complex logic and public APIs
4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging

### Security Practices
1. **Input Validation**: Validate all external inputs
2. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries
3. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets to version control

## Quality Tools Configuration

### pytest.ini
Test runner configuration with coverage requirements.

### .coveragerc
Coverage analysis configuration with exclusions and reporting.

### pyproject.toml
Tool configuration for Black, isort, MyPy, and Bandit.

### .pre-commit-config.yaml
Pre-commit hooks configuration for automated quality checks.

## Troubleshooting Quality Issues

### Low Test Coverage
1. Identify uncovered lines: `python -m coverage report --show-missing`
2. Write tests for uncovered code paths
3. Consider excluding non-testable code with `# pragma: no cover`

### Security Vulnerabilities
1. Review Bandit findings: `python -m bandit -r src -f json`
2. Address high-severity issues immediately
3. Update dependencies: `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`

### Performance Regressions
1. Run benchmark tests: `python -m pytest -m performance`
2. Profile slow code paths
3. Optimize algorithms and database queries

### Type Checking Errors
1. Add type hints to function signatures
2. Install missing type stubs: `pip install types-*`
3. Use `# type: ignore` for unavoidable issues

## Continuous Improvement

### Quality Metrics Tracking
- Monitor coverage trends over time

### Tool Updates
- Regularly update quality tools
- Adopt new best practices and standards
- Review and update quality thresholds

### Team Education
- Regular code review practices
- Quality-focused development training
- Sharing quality improvement knowledge
