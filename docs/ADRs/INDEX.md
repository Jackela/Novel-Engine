# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Novel Engine project. ADRs document the architectural decisions made during the project's development, including the context, alternatives considered, and rationale behind each choice.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The situation that requires a decision
- **Decision**: The chosen solution
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes

## Current ADRs

- [ADR-002: Fog of War Information Filtering](./ADR-002-fog-of-war-filtering.md)  
- [ADR-003: Pydantic Schema Architecture](./ADR-003-pydantic-schemas.md)
- [ADR-004: Context Supply Chain Design](./ADR-004-context-supply-chain.md)
- [ADR-005: Multi-Mode Compliance System](./ADR-005-multi-mode-compliance.md)

## Decision Process

1. **Identify Decision**: Document the architectural choice that needs to be made
2. **Research Alternatives**: Consider multiple viable solutions
3. **Evaluate Trade-offs**: Analyze pros and cons of each alternative  
4. **Make Decision**: Choose the best solution for our context
5. **Document Rationale**: Record the decision and reasoning in an ADR
6. **Review Periodically**: Reassess decisions as the project evolves
