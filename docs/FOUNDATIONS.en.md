# Theoretical Foundations

This project is grounded in Roland Barthes’ 1967 essay “The Death of the Author.” Meaning is not dictated by an author’s singular intent; it emerges from the interplay between language systems and readers. Language precedes the author as a socially shared symbolic structure. Accordingly, the author is no longer the center of meaning; language and cultural systems are. Creation is retrieval and recombination within the “Human Writing System.”

Engineering translation: the goal is not to imitate an author, but to build mechanisms that retrieve, recombine, and validate text in a semantic space. The “author” becomes an orchestrator. Novel Engine does not directly generate meaning; it generates paths through a semantic network. The system’s value lies in compositional logic, semantic constraints, and reproducibility.

Core assumptions and constraints:
- Closed world, open composition: compose within existing semantic distributions without exceeding the statistical bounds of human language.
- Composition as constraint: every generation satisfies logical consistency, semantic coherence, and provenance.
- Originality as rare recombination: “originality” is a low‑probability new path in the semantic graph.

Engineering implications:
- Path diversification
- Entropy‑balanced generation
- Validation‑driven orchestration
- Retrieval mechanisms and traceable weighting
