## Data Architecture

### Data Management Principles

#### Service-Owned Data
- **Data Ownership**: Each service owns its data and schema
- **No Shared Databases**: Services cannot directly access other service databases
- **API-Based Access**: All cross-service data access through APIs
- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency through event-driven updates

#### Polyglot Persistence
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational data requiring ACID properties
- **MongoDB**: Document storage for flexible schemas
- **Redis**: Caching and session storage
- **Elasticsearch**: Search and analytics
- **S3/MinIO**: Large file and media storage

### Data Models by Service

#### Character Service Data Model
```sql
-- Characters table (PostgreSQL)
CREATE TABLE characters (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    type CHARACTER_TYPE NOT NULL,
    personality_traits JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

-- Character Memory (MongoDB)
{
  "_id": "character_id",
  "memories": [
    {
      "id": "memory_id",
      "type": "interaction|event|knowledge",
      "content": "...",
      "timestamp": "ISO_DATE",
      "significance": 0.8,
      "associations": ["related_memory_ids"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Story Engine Data Model
```sql
-- Stories table (PostgreSQL)
CREATE TABLE stories (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    genre STORY_GENRE NOT NULL,
    themes TEXT[],
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

-- Story Content (MongoDB)
{
  "_id": "story_id",
  "plot": {
    "structure": "three_act|hero_journey|...",
    "events": [
      {
        "id": "event_id",
        "type": "...",
        "content": "...",
        "timestamp": "...",
        "participants": ["character_ids"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Campaign Manager Data Model
```sql
-- Campaigns table (PostgreSQL)
CREATE TABLE campaigns (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    configuration JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

-- World State (Redis + PostgreSQL)
-- Real-time state in Redis, persistent state in PostgreSQL
```

### Data Synchronization Patterns

#### Event-Driven Updates
- **Domain Events**: Published when aggregate state changes
- **Event Store**: Persistent event log for audit and replay
- **Projections**: Read models updated from event streams
- **Saga Patterns**: Long-running transactions across services

#### Caching Strategy

---

## Security Architecture

### Security Principles

#### Zero Trust Architecture
- **Verify Everything**: No implicit trust based on network location
- **Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary permissions for all operations
- **Continuous Verification**: Ongoing validation of access and behavior
- **Assume Breach**: Design for compromise detection and containment

#### Defense in Depth
- **Multiple Layers**: Security controls at every architectural level
- **Redundant Controls**: Overlapping security mechanisms
- **Fail Secure**: Security failures result in denial rather than access
- **Monitoring Integration**: Security events integrated with monitoring

### Authentication and Authorization

#### Authentication Strategy
- **OAuth2/OpenID Connect**: Industry standard authentication
- **JWT Tokens**: Stateless token-based authentication
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for sensitive operations
- **API Keys**: Service-to-service authentication

#### Authorization Model
```
Subject → Role → Permission → Resource

Users/Services → Admin/User/Service → Read/Write/Delete → Characters/Stories/Campaigns
```

#### Permission Matrix
```
Resource      | Admin | User  | Service | Anonymous
------------- | ----- | ----- | ------- | ---------
Characters    | CRUD  | CR    | CRUD    | R (public)
Stories       | CRUD  | CRUD  | CRUD    | R (public)
Campaigns     | CRUD  | CRUD  | CR      | None
System Metrics| CRUD  | None  | R       | None
```

### Data Protection

#### Encryption Standards
- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all persistent data
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Key Management**: HashiCorp Vault for key rotation and management
- **PII Handling**: Special handling for personally identifiable information
