# Implementation Patterns (Deprecated Summary)

The full implementation workflow, coding standards, and architectural patterns have
moved to `docs/implementation/implementation_workflow.md` and the supporting ADRs.
This file remains as a compatibility stub so legacy tests that expect the previous
guide to exist continue to pass. See the implementation workflow document for the
complete, versioned guidance.
