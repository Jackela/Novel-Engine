   ├── Creates narrative plan
   └── Coordinates character agents

2. Turn Generation Loop:
   ├── DirectorAgent → CharacterAgent[1]
   ├── CharacterAgent[1] → Story Content
   ├── DirectorAgent → CharacterAgent[2]
   ├── CharacterAgent[2] → Story Content
   └── Repeat for all turns

3. Quality Assessment:
   ├── EvaluationAgent → Content Analysis
   ├── Quality Metrics → Performance Data
   └── Final Story → User Interface
```
