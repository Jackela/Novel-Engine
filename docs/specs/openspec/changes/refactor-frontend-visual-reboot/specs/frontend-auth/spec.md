## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Login visual hierarchy highlights form clarity
The login page MUST visually prioritize the form inputs and primary submit action while retaining the split layout requirements.

#### Scenario: Form remains visually primary
- **WHEN** the login page renders on desktop
- **THEN** the form panel uses higher contrast and stronger hierarchy than the hero panel, and the primary button is visually dominant.
