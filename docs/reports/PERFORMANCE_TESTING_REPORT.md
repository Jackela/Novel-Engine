| 8 Concurrent Simulations | 0.00% | 2.76 | ❌ Failed |

**Critical Issue**: Story generation endpoint `/simulations` is completely non-functional, returning 404 errors for all requests.

### System Resource Usage
| Metric | Average | Maximum | Assessment |
|--------|---------|---------|------------|
| CPU Usage (%) | 0.0 | 1.5 | ✅ Excellent efficiency |
| Memory Usage (%) | 0.1 | 0.1 | ✅ Excellent efficiency |
