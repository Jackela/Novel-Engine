- **CSS Custom Properties**: Sophisticated theming system with light/dark mode support and smooth transitions (0.3s ease)
- **Modern CSS Architecture**: Advanced use of CSS Grid, Flexbox, transforms, and backdrop-filter effects
- **Material-UI Integration**: Proper implementation of responsive Grid system with consistent spacing

#### **Visual Consistency & Theming**
- **Design Token System**: Comprehensive CSS variable system for colors, spacing, typography, and animations
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Accessibility-first CSS with high contrast mode and reduced motion support
- **Component-Based Styling**: Consistent design language across character selection, dashboard, and creation flows

#### **Build Optimization**
- **Vite Configuration**: Optimized with manual chunk splitting, tree-shaking, and asset optimization
- **Performance Budget**: 4KB inline asset limit, terser optimization with console removal in production
- **Development Experience**: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) optimization and source map generation

### ⚠️ **Critical Issues**

#### **Layout Inconsistencies**
- **Mobile First Gaps**: Split panel layouts revert to column stacking without optimized mobile experiences
- **Content Overflow**: Several components lack proper overflow handling on constrained screens
- **Typography Scaling**: Limited fluid typography implementation - fixed breakpoint scaling may cause readability issues

#### **Component Architecture**
- **Mixed Paradigms**: Inconsistent use of JSX vs TSX files creates maintenance complexity
- **Style Organization**: CSS modules mixed with global styles without clear architecture guidelines

## ⚡ Wave 2: Performance Engineering Analysis

### ✅ **Outstanding Performance Architecture**

#### **Real-Time Performance Monitoring**
- **Advanced Metrics Tracking**: Comprehensive performance hook measuring render time, memory usage, frame drops, and interaction delays
- **Performance Budgeting**: 16.67ms render time target (60fps), 100MB memory limit, 100ms interaction delay threshold
- **Intelligent Optimization**: Automatic optimization level detection with progressive enhancement strategies

#### **Network & API Performance**
- **Intelligent Caching System**: Multi-layer API caching with TTL management, LRU eviction, and cache invalidation strategies
- **Request Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate API calls with promise-based request management
- **WebSocket Optimization**: Advanced connection management with exponential backoff, message queuing, and compression support

#### **Bundle & Resource Optimization**
- **Code Splitting**: Vendor chunks separated (React, Material-UI, utilities) for optimal caching
- **Asset Management**: 4KB inline limit with source map generation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time bundle size analysis and resource timing measurement

### ⚠️ **Performance Concerns**

#### **Memory Management**
- **WebSocket Memory**: Potential memory leaks in WebSocket message history (10,000 message limit may be excessive)
- **Cache Growth**: API cache size limit (500 entries) may be insufficient for large applications
- **Performance Observer**: Limited browser support for advanced performance APIs

#### **Mobile Performance**
- **Bundle Size**: Total bundle size analysis incomplete - no specific mobile optimization strategy
- **Network Conditions**: Limited adaptive loading strategies for poor network conditions
- **Battery Impact**: Missing battery-aware optimizations for mobile devices

## ♿ Wave 3: Accessibility & Quality Assurance Analysis

### ✅ **Accessibility Foundations**

#### **WCAG 2.1 Implementation**
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of roles, headings hierarchy, and landmark navigation
- **ARIA Support**: Comprehensive implementation of aria-label, aria-pressed, aria-describedby, and aria-live regions
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Enter/Space key support for interactive elements with proper focus management
- **Screen Reader Support**: Live regions for dynamic content updates and error announcements

#### **Touch & Interaction Design**
- **Touch Target Sizes**: Mostly adherent to 44px minimum (36px main targets, 32px mobile fallback)
- **Focus Indicators**: Proper focus styling with high contrast support
- **Error Handling**: Accessible error messages with role="alert" and proper context

### ❌ **Critical Accessibility Gaps**

#### **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Issues**
- **Color Contrast**: Missing contrast ratio validation - gradient text may fail contrast requirements
- **Focus Management**: Incomplete focus trap implementation in modal dialogs
- **Alternative Text**: Limited alt text implementation for dynamic content and loading states
- **Language Support**: Missing lang attributes for multilingual content

#### **Mobile Accessibility**
- **Touch Target Consistency**: 32px mobile targets below recommended 44px minimum
- **Screen Reader Navigation**: Missing skip links and landmark navigation
- **Zoom Compatibility**: No testing for 200% zoom accessibility requirement

#### **Form Accessibility**
- **Error Association**: Limited error message association with form controls
- **Required Fields**: Missing required field indicators and validation
- **Input Descriptions**: Incomplete aria-describedby implementation
