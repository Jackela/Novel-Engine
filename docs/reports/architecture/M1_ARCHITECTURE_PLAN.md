# M1 Architecture Plan - Novel Engine Evolution

**Generated**: 2025-08-26  
**Purpose**: Define M1 milestone architecture with modern directory structure  
**Strategy**: Evolutionary architecture building on M0 refactoring foundation

---

## M1 Vision

Transform Novel Engine from a refactored monolith into a **modern, domain-driven architecture** with clear separation of concerns, scalable microservices foundation, and enterprise-grade deployment capabilities.

### Architectural Principles

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear context boundaries and domain separation
2. **Platform Engineering**: Reusable platform services and cross-cutting concerns
3. **Microservices Ready**: Application services with defined boundaries
4. **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete deployment automation and environment management
5. **Documentation-Driven**: Comprehensive architectural documentation and knowledge management

## Top-Level Directory Structure

### **apps/** - Application Services Layer
**Purpose**: Application entry points and service definitions  
**Pattern**: Microservices architecture with individual service definitions

```
apps/
├── api-gateway/          # Main API orchestration and routing
├── story-engine/         # Core narrative generation service  
├── character-service/    # Character management and lifecycle
├── campaign-manager/     # Campaign orchestration and management
├── memory-service/       # Centralized memory management
└── monitoring/           # System observability and health
```

**Current Migration**: Move from root-level API servers to organized services

### **contexts/** - Domain Contexts Layer  
**Purpose**: Domain contexts and bounded contexts (DDD pattern)  
**Pattern**: Domain-Driven Design with clear context boundaries

```
contexts/
├── characters/           # Character domain (personas, agents, lifecycle)
├── narratives/           # Story generation domain (plots, events, content)
├── campaigns/            # Campaign domain (sessions, world state, persistence)
├── interactions/         # Interaction domain (dialogue, combat, cooperation)
├── orchestration/        # Multi-agent coordination domain
└── shared/               # Shared kernel and cross-context utilities
```

**Current Migration**: Organize existing domains into clear contexts

### **platform/** - Platform Services Layer
**Purpose**: Platform services and cross-cutting concerns  
**Pattern**: Platform engineering with reusable components

```
platform/
├── ai-services/          # LLM integration and AI orchestration
├── caching/              # Performance optimization and caching
├── memory/               # Memory management system
├── validation/           # Quality assurance and validation
├── security/             # Security services and middleware
├── monitoring/           # Observability platform services
└── infrastructure/       # Platform infrastructure components
```

**Current Migration**: Elevate cross-cutting concerns to platform layer

### **deployment/** - Deployment Orchestration Layer
**Purpose**: Enhanced deployment orchestration and environment management  
**Pattern**: Infrastructure as Code with full automation

```
deployment/
├── environments/         # Environment-specific configurations
├── kubernetes/           # Kubernetes manifests and configs
├── docker/               # Container definitions and compose files
├── terraform/            # Infrastructure as Code definitions
├── scripts/              # Deployment automation scripts
├── monitoring/           # Deployment monitoring and health checks
└── security/             # Security scanning and compliance
```

**Current Migration**: Enhance existing deploy/ structure

### **docs/** - Documentation and Knowledge Layer
**Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation and knowledge management  
**Pattern**: Living documentation with architectural decision records

```
docs/
├── architecture/         # System design and architectural decisions
├── api/                  # API documentation and specifications
├── guides/               # User and developer guides
├── operations/           # Runbooks and operational procedures
├── domains/              # Domain-specific documentation
├── deployment/           # Deployment and infrastructure guides
└── decisions/            # Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
```

**Current Migration**: Organize and enhance existing comprehensive docs

### Wave 2: Domain Organization  
1. Migrate existing components into appropriate contexts
2. Establish shared kernel and cross-context interfaces
3. Implement domain service boundaries

### Wave 3: Platform Services
1. Extract cross-cutting concerns to platform layer
2. Implement platform service interfaces
3. Establish service discovery and communication patterns

### Wave 4: Application Services
1. Create microservice-ready application definitions
2. Implement API gateway and service orchestration
3. Establish service boundaries and interfaces

### Wave 5: Deployment Enhancement
1. Enhance deployment automation and orchestration
2. Implement infrastructure as code
3. Establish monitoring and observability
