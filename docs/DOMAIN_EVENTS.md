## Domain Events Overview

### Purpose
Domain events represent significant business occurrences within the Novel Engine M1 system. They enable decoupled communication between bounded contexts, support event sourcing patterns, and provide a foundation for eventual consistency across microservices.

### Event-Driven Architecture Benefits
- **Decoupling**: Bounded contexts communicate through well-defined events
- **Scalability**: Asynchronous processing enables horizontal scaling
- **Resilience**: Event replay and compensation patterns support fault tolerance
- **Auditability**: Complete event log provides audit trail and debugging capability
- **Integration**: External systems can subscribe to relevant business events

### Design Principles
- **Domain-Centric**: Events represent meaningful business occurrences
- **Immutable**: Events are immutable facts about what happened
- **Self-Contained**: Events contain all necessary data for processing
- **Versioned**: Events support schema evolution and backward compatibility
- **Traceable**: Events include correlation and causation identifiers

## Event Architecture

### Event Structure
```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid",
  "eventType": "domain.aggregate.action",
  "eventVersion": "1.0.0",
  "aggregateId": "uuid",
  "aggregateType": "Character|Story|Campaign|Interaction",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "correlationId": "uuid",
  "causationId": "uuid",
  "userId": "uuid",
  "payload": {
    // Event-specific data
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source": "service-name",
    "trace": "trace-id",
    "schema": "schema-url"
  }
}
```

### Event Categories
- **Command Events**: Actions initiated by users or systems
- **Domain Events**: Business-significant state changes
- **Integration Events**: Cross-context communication events
- **System Events**: Infrastructure and operational events
- **Notification Events**: User notification triggers

### Event Processing Patterns
- **Event Sourcing**: Aggregate state derived from event sequence
- **CQRS**: Separate command and query models updated by events
- **Saga Pattern**: Long-running transactions coordinated through events
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time event processing and routing
- **Event Store**: Persistent event log with replay capabilities

## Event Handling Patterns

### Event Processing Strategies

#### Immediate Processing
- **Use Case**: Critical business events requiring immediate action
- **Examples**: User authentication, payment processing, security events
- **Implementation**: Synchronous event handlers with immediate response
- **Guarantees**: Strong consistency, immediate feedback

#### Asynchronous Processing
- **Use Case**: Non-critical events that can be processed later
- **Examples**: Analytics updates, notification sending, cache updates
- **Implementation**: Event queues with background processing
- **Guarantees**: Eventual consistency, high throughput

#### Batch Processing
- **Use Case**: High-volume events that can be processed in groups
- **Examples**: Log aggregation, metrics calculation, reporting
- **Implementation**: Event batching with scheduled processing
- **Guarantees**: High efficiency, delayed processing

### Error Handling and Resilience

#### Retry Patterns
```yaml
retryPolicy:
  maxAttempts: 3
  backoffStrategy: "exponential"
  baseDelay: 1000ms
  maxDelay: 30000ms
  retryableErrors:
    - "network-timeout"
    - "service-unavailable"
    - "temporary-failure"
```

#### Dead Letter Queues
- **Purpose**: Handle events that cannot be processed after retries
- **Implementation**: Dedicated queues for failed events
- **Monitoring**: Alert on dead letter queue accumulation
- **Recovery**: Manual review and reprocessing capabilities

#### Compensation Patterns
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transaction management
- **Compensation Events**: Undo operations for failed transactions
- **Idempotency**: Safe event replay and duplicate handling
- **State Recovery**: Restore consistent state after failures

### Event Versioning and Evolution

#### Schema Evolution
```yaml
eventSchema:
  version: "1.0.0"
  compatibilityMode: "backward-compatible"
  changes:
    - type: "field-added"
      field: "newField"
      optional: true
    - type: "field-deprecated"
      field: "oldField"
      removalVersion: "2.0.0"
```

#### Version Migration
- **Backward Compatibility**: New versions can process old events
- **Forward Compatibility**: Old versions can process new events (with defaults)
- **Migration Strategies**: Gradual rollout with version support
- **Deprecation Policy**: Clear timeline for version deprecation

---

## Integration Guidelines

### Event Publishing

#### Publisher Responsibilities
- **Event Completeness**: Include all necessary data in event payload
- **Event Ordering**: Maintain causal ordering for related events
- **Error Handling**: Handle publishing failures gracefully
- **Schema Compliance**: Validate events against published schemas

#### Publishing Best Practices
```python
# Example event publishing pattern
async def publish_character_created_event(character: Character):
    event = CharacterCreatedEvent(
        eventId=generate_uuid(),
        aggregateId=character.id,
        timestamp=datetime.utcnow(),
        payload={
            "characterId": character.id,
            "name": character.name,
            "type": character.type,
            "personalityTraits": character.personality_traits,
            "background": character.background,
            "configuration": character.configuration,
            "createdBy": character.created_by
        }
    )
    await event_bus.publish(event)
```

### Event Subscription

#### Subscriber Responsibilities
- **Idempotency**: Handle duplicate events safely
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and retries
- **Performance**: Process events efficiently to avoid backlogs
- **State Management**: Maintain consistent state from events

#### Subscription Patterns
```python
# Example event subscription pattern
@event_handler("characters.character.created")
async def handle_character_created(event: CharacterCreatedEvent):
    try:
        # Initialize character memory
        await memory_service.create_character_memory(
            character_id=event.payload.characterId,
            initial_profile=event.payload
        )
        
        # Register with story engine
        await story_engine.register_character(
            character_id=event.payload.characterId,
            character_data=event.payload
        )
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to handle character created event: {e}")
        raise  # Event will be retried
```

### Monitoring and Observability

#### Event Metrics
- **Publishing Metrics**: Event publication rates, failures, latency
- **Processing Metrics**: Event processing rates, failures, backlog size
- **Business Metrics**: Domain-specific event patterns and trends
- **System Metrics**: Event store performance, queue depths, errors

#### Event Tracing
- **Correlation IDs**: Track event flows across services
- **Causation IDs**: Understand event cause-and-effect relationships
- **Distributed Tracing**: Trace event processing across system boundaries
- **Event Lineage**: Track event origins and transformations

## Conclusion

This domain events catalog provides the foundation for event-driven communication within Novel Engine M1. The catalog will evolve as new domains are added and existing domains mature, maintaining consistency with the overall system architecture.

### Implementation Priorities
1. **Core Events**: Implement essential lifecycle events for each domain
2. **Integration Events**: Establish cross-domain communication patterns
3. **Monitoring Events**: Add observability and operational events
4. **Advanced Events**: Implement complex workflow and orchestration events

### Maintenance Guidelines
- **Regular Reviews**: Quarterly review of event catalog completeness
- **Schema Management**: Maintain event schema registry with versioning
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep event documentation synchronized with implementation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor event processing performance and optimize as needed
