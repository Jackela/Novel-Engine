Turn Orchestration Application Layer

Application services and command/query handlers for the M9 Orchestration system.

This layer contains:
- Application services that orchestrate domain operations
- Command handlers for turn execution requests  
- Query handlers for turn status and monitoring
- Application-specific DTOs and response models

The application layer coordinates between the domain layer (business logic)
and infrastructure layer (external integrations) while keeping the domain
layer isolated from external concerns.
