Narrative Engine Test Suite - "Shadows of Serenity Station"
==========================================================

Comprehensive test suite for the narrative engine implementation that validates
non-combat narrative scenarios. This suite tests the integration of DirectorAgent
narrative enhancements, PersonaAgent story intelligence, and narrative action
framework through the "Shadows of Serenity Station" test scenario.

The test suite validates:
1. Campaign brief loading and parsing
2. Narrative context generation and character-specific injection
3. Non-combat action processing (investigate, dialogue, diplomacy, betrayal)
4. Story progression and coherence validation
5. Character agency in story-driven decisions
