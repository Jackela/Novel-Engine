AI Enhancement Analysis Report
==============================

This script provides a comprehensive analysis of the improvements achieved
through real AI integration in the Warhammer 40k Multi-Agent Simulator,
comparing the enhanced system with AI-generated character decisions against
the previous placeholder-based approach.

The analysis covers:
- Character decision quality and complexity
- Narrative generation improvements
- System performance with real AI integration
- Demonstration of end-to-end AI-powered workflow
- Quality metrics and success indicators

This report validates the successful implementation of production-ready
AI integration throughout the entire simulation pipeline.
